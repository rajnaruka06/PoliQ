## Data sources and update frequency
The data in this database comes from two main sources:

1. **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)**: 
   - The ABS tables (`abs_*`) contain data from the Australian Census, which is conducted every 5 years (most recently in 2021). 
   - The data is typically updated after each Census, so the latest year available will depend on when the database was last updated.

2. **Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)**:
   - The AEC tables (`aec_*`) contain data on federal elections, which are held at least every 3 years.
   - Election data is updated after each federal election.
   - Some AEC tables, like `aec_booths` and `AEC_CEDs`, may be updated more frequently to reflect changes.
