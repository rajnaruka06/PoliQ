Analysis of this data can reveal geographic patterns in support for minor parties, the impact of local campaigning efforts, and variations in voter behavior between early voting and election day. This information is crucial for understanding the evolving political landscape, identifying areas where minor parties are gaining traction, and assessing the potential for electoral upsets in future elections."

This comprehensive dataset captures the collective performance of all parties and candidates outside the major parties (Liberal, National, and Labor) across different electorates. It provides crucial insights into the diversity of political preferences and the strength of alternative voices in Australian politics. Analyzing this data can reveal trends such as the rise of populist movements, the impact of single-issue parties, and the growing influence of independents in certain areas. It's particularly valuable for understanding voter dissatisfaction with major parties, the emergence of new political forces, and shifts in the political landscape. This information is essential for major parties in identifying potential threats to their voter base and areas where preference deals might be crucial. For minor parties and independents, it helps in identifying potential growth areas and refining their campaign strategies. The data also reflects broader societal trends and changing voter priorities, making it a key resource for political analysts, policy makers, and researchers studying Australian electoral behavior and political dynamics."

This dataset focuses specifically on votes cast at polling places on election day for all parties and candidates outside the major parties. It provides valuable insights into the performance of minor parties and independents among voters who participate in the traditional voting process. Analyzing ordinary vote patterns can reveal important trends in voter behavior, such as the effectiveness of election day campaigns, the impact of last-minute political developments, and the ability of minor parties and independents to mobilize supporters to the polls. Comparing ordinary vote percentages with overall results can highlight any discrepancies between election day voting and other voting methods, which may indicate different levels of support among various voter demographics or the effectiveness of different campaign strategies. This information is crucial for understanding the evolving political landscape, the appeal of alternative political voices, and the potential for electoral surprises on voting day. It's particularly useful for minor parties and independents in refining their campaign tactics, allocating resources for booth volunteers, and identifying areas where they have strong on-the-ground support."

This dataset is crucial for understanding the final electoral standing of National parties after the distribution of preferences, particularly in rural and regional seats. Two-candidate preferred (TCP) results show how National candidates perform in head-to-head contests, typically against Labor, Liberal, or Independent candidates in non-metropolitan areas. This data is essential for assessing the overall competitiveness of National parties, their ability to attract preferences from eliminated candidates, and their potential to win seats in their traditional strongholds. Analyzing TCP results can reveal the true strength of National candidates beyond their primary vote, indicating their broader appeal to the rural and regional electorate and their capacity to maintain or expand their parliamentary representation."

This dataset is crucial for understanding the final electoral standing of minor and independent parties after the distribution of preferences. Two-candidate preferred (TCP) results show how candidates from smaller parties perform in head-to-head contests, typically against major party candidates. This data is essential for assessing the overall competitiveness of minor parties, their ability to attract preferences from eliminated candidates, and their potential to win seats or influence outcomes in closely contested electorates. Analyzing TCP results can reveal the true strength of minor party candidates beyond their primary vote, indicating their broader appeal to the electorate and their capacity to challenge the dominance of major parties in certain areas. This information is valuable for understanding the evolving political landscape, the potential for minor parties to hold balance of power positions, and the effectiveness of preference deals and voting strategies."

It's crucial for understanding the true electoral competitiveness of smaller political entities and independents in situations where they make it to the final count. This data provides insights into the preference flows from eliminated candidates and the overall appeal of minor parties and independents when voters are forced to choose between two final options. Analysts can use this information to assess the potential for minor party or independent victories in close contests, understand the impact of preference deals, and identify electorates where non-major party candidates have significant support bases capable of challenging the major parties."

This comprehensive dataset captures the initial support for a wide range of smaller political parties and independent candidates across all electorates. The 2010 election was particularly significant as it resulted in a hung parliament, where minor parties and independents played a crucial role in forming government. Analyzing this data can reveal the diversity of political views across Australia, identify emerging political movements, and show the strength of alternatives to the major parties. It's valuable for understanding voter dissatisfaction with major parties, the appeal of single-issue parties, and the performance of local independent candidates. This information is crucial for political analysts, campaign strategists, and researchers studying Australian electoral behavior, particularly in understanding the fragmentation of the political landscape, the rise of populist movements, and the potential for minor parties to influence policy outcomes. The data can also be used to assess the impact of preference deals, identify electorates where minor parties have significant support bases, and analyze the overall influence of minor parties and independents on election outcomes in Australia's preferential voting system."

Analyzing this data can reveal the effectiveness of grassroots campaigns, the appeal of alternative political options to election day voters, and the geographic distribution of support for smaller parties.

This dataset shows how voters for eliminated candidates redistributed their preferences between the final two candidates in each electorate, particularly when a minor party or independent candidate was one of the final two. It provides insights into preference flows, the competitiveness of minor parties and independents in close contests, and their potential to influence election outcomes. Analyzing this data can reveal the strategic importance of preference deals, the effectiveness of 'how-to-vote' cards, and the overall impact of the preferential voting system on minor party and independent performance. This information is crucial for understanding the full electoral strength of non-major party candidates and the dynamics of Australia's preferential voting system."

This dataset represents the final head-to-head contest in electorates where the Greens were one of the final two candidates after the distribution of preferences from eliminated candidates. It provides a clear picture of the Greens' overall electoral strength in these key divisions. Analyzing this data reveals the true level of support for the Greens when voters' full preferences are considered, showing where the party was most competitive and came closest to winning seats. This information is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the Greens' preference deals, their appeal to supporters of other parties and independents, and their potential to win seats in future elections. It's particularly valuable for political strategists, election analysts, and researchers studying the rise of minor parties and the impact of Australia's preferential voting system. The 2007 election saw the Greens increase their vote share, and this two-candidate preferred data helps in understanding the full extent of their support in key battleground electorates, providing insights into their growing influence on Australian politics and their potential to shape policy outcomes through preference flows."

It allows for analysis of how minor parties and independents perform in the standard election day environment, which can differ from early or postal voting patterns. This information is valuable for understanding the effectiveness of election day campaigning by smaller political entities, their ability to mobilize supporters on the day, and potential differences in support between election day voters and those who use alternative voting methods. The data can reveal important trends in voter behavior, such as the impact of last-minute campaigning or election day events on support for minor parties and independents."

It includes data for a wide range of minor parties and independents, allowing for analysis of their impact on the final outcome in each seat. TCP data is crucial for understanding the full extent of a party's or candidate's support, as it takes into account both primary votes and preference flows. This information is valuable for analyzing the effectiveness of preference deals, the strength of ideological alignments between parties, and the overall competitiveness of elections in different electorates. It's particularly useful for identifying seats where minor parties or independents play a crucial role in determining the outcome."

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the initial support for a wide range of minor parties across different electorates. It captures the first preference votes cast for these parties, offering insights into their core support base and appeal to voters before the distribution of preferences. This information is crucial for understanding the political landscape beyond the major parties, revealing the diversity of political views and the strength of various minor parties in different regions. It can be used to analyze trends in voter behavior, the effectiveness of campaign strategies for smaller parties, and the potential for minor parties to influence election outcomes or policy debates. The data is particularly valuable for identifying emerging political movements, assessing the impact of local issues on voting patterns, and understanding the fragmentation of the political spectrum in Australian politics."

This granular dataset provides a detailed view of support for National Party candidates at individual voting locations on election day, particularly in rural and regional areas. It offers valuable insights into the geographic distribution of National Party support within electorates, allowing for analysis of local factors influencing voting patterns in non-urban Australia. Researchers can use this data to identify strongholds of National Party support, examine the impact of local rural issues or candidate visibility, and assess the effectiveness of targeted campaigning strategies in regional communities. The booth-level data enables the study of voting trends in specific rural and regional communities, such as farming areas, small towns, or regions with distinct agricultural or resource-based economies. This information is crucial for understanding the nuanced appeal of National Party candidates across different rural localities and can inform future campaign strategies tailored to specific regional needs. Political analysts can use this dataset to map voting patterns in rural Australia, identify swing areas in regional electorates, and explore the relationship between local community characteristics and support for the National Party."

This dataset provides crucial insights into the final electoral performance of National Party candidates after the distribution of preferences. It reflects the party's competitiveness in rural and regional areas where they often face strong challenges from major parties or independents. The two-candidate preferred (TCP) vote is a key metric in Australia's preferential voting system, indicating the ultimate level of support for National Party candidates when matched against their strongest opponent. This data is valuable for analyzing the National Party's electoral strength, identifying marginal seats, and understanding preference flows from other parties to National candidates. Researchers can use this information to assess the effectiveness of National Party campaign strategies, examine regional voting patterns, and explore the impact of preference deals with other parties. The dataset is particularly useful for political analysts studying the National Party's performance in traditional rural strongholds and potential expansion areas, as well as for predicting outcomes in future elections based on historical TCP trends."

This information is valuable for analyzing the effectiveness of minor parties' and independents' outreach to postal voters, understanding demographic differences in voting methods, and identifying any disparities in support between postal and in-person voters. Researchers can use this data to examine the impact of campaign strategies targeting postal voters, assess the accessibility of the electoral process for different voter groups, and investigate potential correlations between postal voting rates and support for minor parties or independents in various regions."

The information allows researchers to analyze trends in pre-poll voting for non-major party candidates, such as the impact of early campaigning, voter convenience factors, or demographic shifts in voting behavior. Comparing pre-poll results with other voting methods offers insights into the effectiveness of minor parties' and independents' early campaign strategies and their ability to secure support ahead of election day. This dataset is valuable for electoral analysts, political scientists, and campaign strategists in understanding the growing importance of pre-poll voting and its implications for the performance of minor parties and independents in Australian federal elections across different electoral divisions."

This dataset provides crucial insights into the final distribution of votes between the top two candidates in each electorate, including cases where minor parties or independents made it to the final count. It allows for analysis of voter preferences and the competitiveness of non-major party candidates in different regions. Researchers can use this data to identify areas where minor parties or independents have strong support, examine the impact of preference flows, and assess the potential for electoral upsets. The CED-level data enables comparison of minor party performance across different types of electorates, such as urban, rural, or marginal seats. This information is valuable for understanding the evolving political landscape, the effectiveness of minor party campaigns, and the potential for changes in seat outcomes based on preference distributions."

This highly granular dataset provides a detailed view of support for minor parties at individual voting locations on election day. It offers valuable insights into the geographic distribution of minor party support within electorates, allowing for analysis of local factors influencing voting patterns. Researchers can use this data to identify strongholds of support for specific minor parties, examine the impact of local issues or candidate visibility, and assess the effectiveness of targeted campaigning strategies in specific communities. The booth-level data enables the study of voting trends in distinct neighborhoods, such as urban centers, suburban areas, or rural localities, providing a nuanced understanding of the appeal of minor parties across different demographic and socioeconomic contexts. This information is crucial for understanding the localized appeal of minor parties and can inform future campaign strategies tailored to specific community needs and preferences. Political analysts can use this dataset to map detailed voting patterns, identify swing areas within electorates, and explore the relationship between local community characteristics and support for minor parties. The granularity of this data makes it particularly valuable for micro-targeting strategies and for understanding the complex dynamics of voter behavior at the most local level."

      "context": "Percentage of two-candidate preferred votes for minor parties in the 2004 Australian Federal Election by Commonwealth Electoral Division (CED). This dataset provides crucial insights into the performance of minor parties in the final count of votes, where preferences have been distributed. It allows for analysis of the true support for minor parties after preference flows, which is particularly important in the Australian preferential voting system. The data is aggregated at the CED level, offering a comprehensive view of minor party performance across different regions of Australia. This information is valuable for understanding the impact of preference deals, the effectiveness of minor party campaigns, and the overall political landscape beyond the major parties. Researchers and analysts can use this data to identify areas where minor parties have significant influence, even if they don't win seats outright. It's also useful for studying trends in voter behavior, particularly in how preferences are allocated and how this affects the final outcome in each division. This dataset is essential for anyone looking to understand the nuances of Australian electoral politics, the distribution of political support across the country, and the role of minor parties in shaping election outcomes."
